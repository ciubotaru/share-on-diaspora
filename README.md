share-on-diaspora
=================

A wordpress plugin that adds a "share on D*" button to posts

ToDo
====

* Add a screen shot of the settings page.
* Add plugin version number to screenshot captions.
* Add plugin description to 'readme.txt'. This will also result in tags being displayed on the plugin webpage.
* Make a cover picture for the plugin webpage.
* Reference the cover picture from Wordpress Plugin Directory in readme.md, so that it gets displayed on GitHub, too.
* Think about how to present the list of pods. E.g., a new tab in the Settings page, where the blog admin can select which pods get displayed in the drop-down list.
* Complete the FAQ and the installation info.
* Think about how to add a graphical color-picker to the settings page. JavaScript?
* Think how to update preview automatically. JavaScript?
* Find out how to work with tabs in the Settings page.
